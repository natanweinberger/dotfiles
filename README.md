# Dotfiles

- Run `install.sh` from anywhere in order to source all the dotfiles
- Call `install.sh` in your `.bash_profile` by sourcing it: `./path/to/dotfiles/install.sh`

# Notes
Most Unix systems run `.bash_profile` in login shells and `.bashrc` in every interactive shell.

On macOS, when Terminal.app opens a new window, it will run `.bash_profile`, not `.bashrc`.
